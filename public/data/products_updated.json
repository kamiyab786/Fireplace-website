The porous stone pulls moisture away from your pizza crust and yields crispy and light results, just like pizza fresh from a pizzeria. Like your favorite cast iron frying pan, this stone will season over time, making it more effective. It is recommended that you hand wash your PRO Series Pizza Stone by hand, with warm water, once completely cooled. Avoid soapy water and scrubbing.

The reveRSIBle design allows you to roast a big beef, chicken, or pork roast, elevating it off the cooking grids for convection and airflow. Flip the rack over and it converts into a beer can chicken roaster, stabilizing the can and the chicken for a delicious meal. Don't forget to use a drip tray under your roasts to catch all of those delicious juices for the best gravy ever! This roasting rack is great for sliding up to four racks of ribs into the slots. This quadruples the number of ribs you can grill to perfection. Cooking ribs upright reduces the chance of charring and allows for more airflow for the ideal amount of smoke on all sides. Dishwasher safe, the 3-in-1 Roasting Rack is easy to clean. Clever, multifunctional, and easy to maintain, every kitchen benefits from the addition of a Napoleon barbecue accessory. Our accessories provide you with the essentials to create delicious grilled food and then some to enhance your cooking arsenal with a wide variety of creative additions to broaden your culinary horizons.</p>",

The 25G has a 25\u201d (635mm) diameter black oil-seasoned steel heated underneath by inner and outer gas tube burners. Evo\u2019s technology allows independent heat adjustment across inner and outer cook surface zones for managing a wide range of menu possibilities. Heat is delivered to each burner via separate inner and outer control knobs.</p><p>Edge-to-edge even surface temperatures range from 225\u00baF to 525\u00baF (121\u00baC to 274\u00baC) from the center to the outside edge without the hot spots and temperature problems prone to traditional square griddles. The burner system has a push button electronic ignition system which ignites both burners simultaneously. A stainless steel drip pan completely surrounds the underside of the cook surface catching all food debris. Separate spill over trays that contain and hold drip pan debris are concealed in front doors at  right and left side of the control panel. Operating on either Natural Gas or Propane LP Gas, the Affinity 25G Cooktop is an ideal solution for creating a social cooking space with any outdoor kitchen.</p><p><strong>Circular Flattop Grill</strong></p><ul><li>25\u201d (635mm) circular oil seasoned steel cooking surface.</li><li>Two temperature zones between inner and outer surface.</li><li>Variable temperatures 225\u00baF to 525\u00baF (121\u00baC to 274\u00baC).</li><li>With LP Propane gas total of 27,600 BTUs.</li><li>With Natural Gas total of 31,600 BTUs.</li><li>Knobs separately control inner and outer burners.</li><li>Electronic push button ignition.</li><li>Natural Gas or LP Propane gas.</li></ul>",

Remove the Apple Wood Chips from the soaking liquid and place them into the Napoleon Smoker Pipe, then place the pipe onto the sear plates of a gas grill. Conversely, you could place the soaked Apple Wood Chips into the smoker tray, integrated directly into the Napoleon Prestige PRO Series PRO665RSIB Gas Grill, or right onto the lit coals of an Apollo\u00ae 3 in 1 Charcoal Grill and Water Smoker. When the chips begin smoking, place your food directly on the grill and close the lid, trapping the sweet smoke in with the food. Remember to keep the lid closed and only check the food when necessary to get the most out of the Apple Wood Chip smoke flavor.</p>",

Larger and longer-lasting than wood chips, these Applewood Smoking Chunks are ideal for use in smoker grills, charcoal barbecue grills, the Napoleon Charcoal Tray Accessory, and the Napoleon Stainless Steel Smoker Box Accessory. The smoke from the semi-hard Applewood Chunks is lighter and sweet compared to other hardwoods and pairs perfectly with pork, poultry, lamb, fish, game, fruit, cheese and vegetables. Place the wood chunks directly in lit charcoal for immediate smoke flavor. Set up for a timed release of smoke when doing longer cooks by placing chunks into unlit charcoal, then adding some lit charcoal and a chunk of wood. As the lit charcoal ignites the unlit charcoal, it will also cause the wood to smoke. This means that you won't have to add wood as frequently if at all.</p>",

The Napoleon Stainless Steel Smoker Box is built specifically for use in Napoleon Prestige PRO\u2122, Prestige\u00ae Series, and Rogue\u00ae Series gas barbecue grills. Made from durable stainless steel, this Smoker Box replaces a barbecue's sear plates directly above a lit burner. To use, remove the barbecue's cooking grids and a sear plate directly above a burner. Place the smoker box on the sear plate supports. Fill the high-capacity box with your favorite flavor of wood chips or chunks and put the lid on. Replace the cooking grids and light the burner below the smoker box to low. The chips or chunks will begin to smolder and produce smoke. This is ideal when adding that delicious smoky flavor to your favorite meals. To achieve the best results, the food needs to be on the barbecue for at least 20 minutes.</p>",

Made from durable stainless steel, this Smoker Box replaces a barbecue's sear plates directly above a lit burner. To use, remove the barbecue's cooking grids and a sear plate directly above a burner. Place the smoker box on the sear plate supports. Fill the high-capacity box with your favorite flavor of wood chips or chunks and put the lid on. Replace the cooking grids and light the burner below the smoker box to low. The chips or chunks will begin to smolder and produce smoke. This is ideal when adding that delicious smoky flavor to your favorite meals. To achieve the best results, the food needs to be on the barbecue for at least 20 minutes.</p>",

A linear gas burning fireplace from Kozy Heat is a bold statement compared to many other modern gas fireplaces. With a presence unmatched by traditional fireplaces, our Callaway 50 is 14\u201d tall and 50\u201dlong, giving it a clean, minimal look comparable to a high-end television. This look tends to pair well with \u201cmodern\u201d or minimal design, but also works well with more traditional, high-end spaces. We offer an array of customization options to help you match our fireplace perfectly to your d\u00e9cor.</p><p>In addition to its stunning design, the Callaway 50 comes with an array of high end features relating to heat distribution. With an optional Komfort Zone Kit or a vented cavity, you can safely have non combustables above the fireplace, for example, hang a TV above the fireplace, without exposing it to heat or interrupting the heat distribution. Additionally, Kozy Heat offers interior and exterior heat transfer kits, or a power vent system that allow you to redistribute heat to a different room in your home. During a cool autumn night, our Callaway 50 gas burning fireplace can keep you and your loved ones warm and comfortable.</p><p>With various styling and heat distribution options to choose from, our modern gas fireplaces and other gas burning fireplace inserts will bring the best quality, functionality, and design possible to your space. Kozy Heat is one of the leading gas fireplace manufacturers, and can deliver on the quality and customer service you expect.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.kozyheat.com/product/callaway-50/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\">Click Here for more information</span></strong></a></p><table class=\"ecwid-description-table\"><tbody><tr><td><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><a href=\"https://www.kozyheat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Callaway.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Brochure</a></span></td><td><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><a href=\"https://www.kozyheat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Callaway-50-English-Rev.-8.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Owner's Manual</a></span></td><td \"=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.kozyheat.com/product/callaway-50/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">Specs</span></a><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div>",

Pairing best with seafood, cedar is also great for flavoring vegetables, tofu, pork, chicken and steak. The cooking process produces both smoke and steam which will keep your food moist and flavorful. Napoleon Cedar grilling planks are thicker than most other planks on the market. This means that they are reusable. Simply pre-soak the 100% untreated natural cedar planks in cold water for at least one hour before use to ensure consistent burn and smoke. Then place the plank and food onto a preheated barbecue. When the food is finished, rinse the cedar barbecue plank thoroughly with water and scrape off any food residue. Any stubborn residue can be sanded off. Do not use soap. Allow the plank to dry completely before storing. A plank can be reused until it is approximately 50% charred. The Cedar grilling plank is great for experimental grillers and impressing your guests, these hassle-free planks are easy to use and disposable.</p>",

Once filled, light the paper on fire through the bottom vents of the starter. Allow the paper to burn off, which ignites the bottom coals. The heat from the bottom coals rises igniting the rest.

Remove the wood chips from the liquid and place them in the Napoleon Smoker Tube, then directly onto the sear plates of your gas grill, on your burning charcoal in the Apollo\u00ae 3 in 1 Charcoal Grill and Water Smoker, or into the integrated Smoker Tray in the Napoleon Prestige PRO Series PRO665 Gas Grill. Once the Hickory Wood Chips begin to smoke, put the food you're adding flavor to on the grill. Keep the lid closed while smoking to get the most out of your Hickory Wood Chips.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The JETFIRE\u2122 Chimney Starter is a quick, safe and efficient way to start charcoal for your charcoal barbecue grills. For outdoor use only, this charcoal starter uses a chimney effect that concentrates heat to light the charcoal. Made from aluminized steel with a cool-touch handle (although, grill gloves are recommended when hot) for long-lasting use. Have charcoal hot and ready to use in minutes, the JETFIRE\u2122 Chimney Starter holds enough charcoal to fill most charcoal barbecue grills. To use, fill the underside of the JETFIRE\u2122 Chimney Starter with loosely crumpled newspaper or paper towel. Turn the JETFIRE\u2122 Chimney Starter over and fill the main chamber with as much charcoal as needed for your cook - a few large chunks of hardwood lump charcoal for smoking, up to a full load for some high heat searing. Once filled, light the paper on fire through the bottom vents of the starter. Allow the paper to burn off, which ignites the bottom coals. The heat from the bottom coals rises igniting the rest. Using heat-resistant gloves, lift the JETFIRE\u2122 Chimney Starter by the handle and pour the lit charcoal into your barbecue grill. Clever, multifunctional and easy to maintain, every kitchen benefits from the addition of a Napoleon barbecue accessory. Our accessories provide you with the essentials to create delicious grilled food and then some to enhance your cooking arsenal with a wide variety of creative additions to broaden your culinary horizons.</p>",

Napoleon's grills are equipped with highly efficient sear plates that vaporize grease on contact, but sometimes some gets through. That's when the grease lands in the full-length drip pan and is directed to the disposable grease tray. You should check your grease trays every ten grilling sessions to make sure that they're not filled, and put in a new one if they are. Grease trays are an integral part of your grilling maintenance practice and will help keep your Napoleon running for years to come.</p>",

It gives the food being smoked a sweet and subtle, balanced flavor that is excellent, especially for ham and bacon. Maple Wood Chips are also great for poultry, pork, salmon, arctic char and trout. To use the Maple Wood Chips, soak them in water for at least 30 minutes before you are ready to smoke. They can also be soaked in apple juice, chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, honey brown lager and maple lager for added flavor. When they have been sufficiently soaked, remove the Maple Wood Chips from the liquid and place them into a Napoleon Smoker Pipe, and place that pipe directly on the sear plates of your gas grill. Alternatively you can place soaked chips into the integrated smoker tray on the Prestige PRO\u2122 Series PRO665RSIB Gas Grill, or directly onto the lit charcoal of an Apollo\u00ae 3 in 1 Charcoal Grill and Water Smoker. When the Maple Wood Chips begin to smoke, place the food on the grill and close the lid. Remember to keep the lid closed for the best smoked flavor.</p>",

Fill that indent with your favorite ingredients like cheese, mushrooms and hot peppers. There is no limit to the creative fillings you can use. The surface of the burger and slider press are non-stick making it easy to remove the patties as they're prepared. The burger press has a removable bottom plate for easy extraction. Make two perfectly portioned patties at once in the slider press. Taking out the fresh patties is easy with the removable bottom plate and handle. All parts of the Napoleon Gourmet Burger Press Kit are dishwasher safe, so cleaning is a breeze.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Napoleon's premium pizza stone is perfect for the barbecue grill and baking in the oven too. The porous stone pulls moisture away from your pizza crust, pastries, and breads, yielding crispy and light results. The stone is a natural heat conductor and distributes heat evenly. You can use a Baking Stone to ensure that your barbecue or oven are heating evenly, increasing efficiency when baking. The natural surface doesn't retain odors and flavors; so last week's garlic pizza won't flavor this week's homestyle honey biscuits. Like your favorite cast iron frying pan, this stone will season over time, creating a non-stick surface and making it more effective. It is recommended that you hand wash your premium pizza stone by hand, with warm water, once completely cooled. Avoid soapy water and scrubbing. Whether you are cooking a fresh or frozen pizza, reheating last night's pizza, or baking your favorite pastries, cookies, breads, or desserts, the pizza stone ensures the best results.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Napoleon Grills Rectangular Baking Stone is perfect for the barbecue grill and baking in the oven too. The porous stone pulls moisture away from your pizza crust, pastries, and loaves of bread, yielding crispy and light results. The stone is a natural heat conductor and distributes heat evenly. You can use a baking stone to ensure that your barbecue or oven is heating evenly, increasing efficiency when baking. The natural surface doesn't retain odors and flavors; so last week's garlic pizza won't flavor this week's homestyle honey biscuits. Like your favorite cast iron frying pan, this stone will season over time, creating a non-stick surface and making it more effective. It is recommended that you hand wash your rectangular baking stone by hand, with warm water, once completely cooled, avoid soapy water and scrubbing. Whether you are cooking a fresh or frozen pizza, reheating last night's pizza, or baking your favorite pastries, cookies, loaves of bread, or desserts, the Napoleon Grills Rectangular Baking Stone ensures the best results.</p>",

This knife has a broad face with a large spine that curves down to meet the tip making it ideal for prep work and moving food from the cutting board to the pot.

The integrated handles make it easy to toss, mix and move the stainless steel wok topper with ease.

Available in Black or Stainless Steel, the Sunpak\u00ae Models S25 &amp; S34 are outdoor rated heaters available for use with natural or propane gas. These heaters can be either wall or ceiling mounted. The mounting kit allows this heater to be mounted from above keeping the patio deck free and clear. Heat coverage varies depending on the wind exposure but is approximately a 10 x 10 ft area. Typical mounting height is 8-9 feet from the floor.</p><p>The required clearance from combustible materials must be maintained on all heaters. In addition heaters must have adequate fresh air and ventilation to operate properly. Make sure you can meet these requirements in making your heater selection.</p><p>S25 offers a lower radiant heat output which allows this heater to be located in patios with limited ceiling height.</p><p>S34 offers a greater radiant heat output which allows this heater to be located higher. Also note the above and side clearance requires increases with the higher BTU/Hr unit.</p><p>This heater requires a 24 VAC source and switch or timer or other control device.

    "description": "<p>The NEW Sunpak\u00ae two-stage patio heater is ideal for the commercial environment. Two levels of heat are controllable with an included simple switch. The hardwired control allows you to design a system to control multiple heaters from a panel if desired and durable enough for commercial applications. Three wires are required to control the ON/OFF and HIGH/LOW functions. The 24 VAC low voltage control allows for easy wiring from a transformer to a switch to the heater.</p><p>Sunpak Heaters can effectively heat outdoors because they warm people with infrared radiant heat instead of hot air. Radiant heat warms people and objects such as tables, chairs and floor directly without heating the intervening air. Turn the heaters on to HIGH to warm up a chilled patio and adjust the heaters down to LOW as your guests get comfortable. Proper patio layout and design are important with any patio heating system. We always recommend working with a professional installer to maximize coverage and ensure safety. Each Sunpak heater is CSA designed certified to rigid ANSI standards.</p><h3><br></h3><ul><li>25,000-34,000 BTH/Hr</li><li>Black or Stainless Steel</li><li>Two-Stage Control</li><li>Natural Gas or Propane</li><li>24 VAC \u2013 20 VA</li><li>Electronic Ignition</li><li>Wall or Ceiling Mounted</li><li>CSA Design Certified</li><li>Rain Protected</li><li>Optional Beveled Face Trim</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://sunpak-patio-heaters.com/sunpak-model-s34-tsh/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Click Here for more information</strong></a></p>",

    "description": "<p>The Sunpak S34 TSR is an outdoor gas-fired infrared heater which is operated with a wireless remote control. The heater can be operated at a High setting with an input of 34,000 BTU/Hr or at a LOW setting of 25,000 BTU/Hr. Each heater comes with wireless operating remote controls that are pre-programmed for that heater. The number located on the louvered end of the heater corresponds to the number on the remote control. Should the original remote control become lost, additional remote controls can be purchased. However, the heater will need to be reprogrammed for the new remote control.</p><p>The Sunpak S34-TSR should always be started up and operated on the HIGH mode for the first 5 minutes to allow the heater to warm up. Starting up the heater on the LOW mode before the heater is warmed up may cause the heater to shut down prematurely. To correct this situation press the OFF button followed by the ON button and the HI button. Always PRESS the button for at least 1 second to allow proper transmission of the remote signal.</p><p>Although these heaters are designed for outdoor installation and use, it is important that the wireless remote control(s) be protected from the weather. Should the remote control become wet, it may be necessary to replace the control. Keep controls out of reach of children. Each control has four buttons (ON OFF HI LOW). The remote controls are powered by batteries. The remote control has an approximate 25 foot line of sight range. Weak batteries can limit the effective range of operation.</p><p><br></p><ul><li>25,000-34,000 BTH/Hr</li><li>Black or Stainless Steel</li><li>Two-Stage Control</li><li>Natural Gas or Propane</li><li>7.5 V DC control system</li><li>Wireless Handheld &amp; Wall Remotes</li><li>Programmable up to 3 controls</li><li>Electronic Ignition</li><li>Wall or Ceiling Mounted</li><li>Rain Protected</li><li>CSA Design Certified</li><li>Optional Beveled Face Trim</li><li>Optional Wireless Timer</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://sunpak-patio-heaters.com/sunpak-model-s34-tsr/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Click Here for more information</strong></a></p>",

The natural surface doesn't retain odors and flavors; so last week's garlic pizza won't flavor this week's biscuits. Like your favorite cast iron frying pan, this stone will season over time, for a non-stick surface. It is recommended that you hand wash your TravelQ Baking Stone by hand, with warm water, once completely cooled. Avoid soapy water and scrubbing. Whether you are cooking a fresh or frozen pizza or baking your favorite pastries, cookies, breads, or desserts, the stone ensures the best results. Clever, multifunctional, and easy to maintain, every kitchen benefits from the addition of a Napoleon barbecue accessory.</p>",

They bring out the best in beef, pork, poultry, fish, fruit, and vegetable flavors. Ideal for use in the Napoleon Charcoal Barbecue Grills. Add the fun and flavor of smoke to your gas grill by using the Napoleon Cast Iron Charcoal Tray and Whiskey barrel oak wood chunks. Whiskey Barrel Oak wood chunks are easy to use. Do not soak them, simply place into lit charcoal to produce smoke. For longer smoking periods, place Whiskey Barrel Oak chunks into a layer of unlit hardwood lump charcoal at intervals. Add a small load of lit charcoal to the center of the unlit charcoal and allow that to slowly ignite the remaining charcoal and wood chunks over time.</p>",
